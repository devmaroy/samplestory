# Sample Story

![](screenshot.png)

<br />
Personal project based on React, Gatsby and Wordpress Rest API.

You can modify and use this project or certain components if you wish.

For any questions feel free to contact me at marek@matejovic.cz

<br />

## 🎉 Quick Start

1.  **Clone from Github.**

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:mmatejovic/samplestory.git
    ```

1.  **Run Gatsby command.**

    Navigate into your directory where you cloned repository and start it up.

    ```
    cd my-folder
    ```

    ```
    gatsby develop
    ```

  <br />

**Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!**

Note: You'll also see a second link:  _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_

This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

## 🤔 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in my Gatsby project.

    ├── src

    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js

<br />

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
